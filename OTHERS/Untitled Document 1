Ribose -> H−(C=O)−(CHOH)4−H
DeoxyRibose -> H−(C=O)−(CH2)−(CHOH)3−H

Nucleotides = (Nitrogenous base - C/G/A/T) + (Phosphate group) + (5 carbon sugar - Ribose/Deoxy Ribose)

C:Cytosine, G:Guanine, A:Adenine, T:Thimine (A-T), (C-G)

Nuclic Acid =  Group of Nucleotides

DNA - Deoxyribonucleic acid : Nuclic Acids(with DeOxyRibose as sugar in Nucleotides) --- C/G/A/T(thymine)
RNA - Ribonucleic acid : Nuclic Acids(with Ribose as sugar in Nucleotides)  --- C/G/A/U(uracil)



CpG Island : (5-C-p-G-3) -> Cytosine Nucleotide followed by a Guanine nucleotide
Gpc : Reverse
